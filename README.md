# MongoDB $inc Operator Error when field is missing
This example demonstrates an uncommon error that occurs when using the `$inc` operator in MongoDB update queries. The `$inc` operator increments or decrements a numeric field by a specified value. However, if the field does not exist, the operation fails and the document remains unchanged. This can lead to unexpected behavior in applications that assume `$inc` will create a field if it doesn't exist. The solution involves using the `$setOnInsert` operator to create the field if it doesn't exist or the `$inc` operator along with the `$set` operator in a single query to handle missing fields.  This repo demonstrates both ways to handle the error, leading to more robust MongoDB updates.
